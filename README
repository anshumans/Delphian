simple script for encrypt/decrypt a file containing a list of your passwords.

there are currently only two main commands:

    encrypt <unencrypted_file> <output_file>

This will encrypt the file and write out results to the filename in the second parameter

    decrypt <encrypted_file> <output_file>

This will decrypt file and write out results to the filename in the second parameter
